<p>Today karbytes drew a drawing depicting a three-dimensional object (i.e. a rectangular prism divided into three sections by colored transulcent walls), took a photograph of that drawing using karbytes&#8217; Android phone, digitally modified that resulting image according to karbytes&#8217; aesthetic preferences, and then uploaded that image to karbytes&#8217; Instagram and to karbytes&#8217; GitHub. The drawing was illuminated by daylight after sunset.</p>
