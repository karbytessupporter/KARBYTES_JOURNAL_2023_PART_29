One last thing: I think that as much of the essential labor of human civilization as possible should be outsourced to robots instead of continuing to be performed by humans. Corporations can still continue to provide commercial commodities which citizens supply a sufficiently high demand for and pay taxes from the profits earned by selling those commodities while significantly reducing the costs of production due to the fact that robots generally cost less to employ (and robots tend to be more efficient and perform work of a consistently high quality while humans tend to be orders of magnitude less efficient and perform orders of magnitude more poorly than the robot workers). Perhaps more than 90% of humans will opt out of the workforce in order to subsist entirely on government issued provisions (which are paid for by companies which mostly employ robots to do the essential labor for those companies such as manufacturing products, transporting those products, and analyzing metrics concerning the supply and demand of those products (and such analysis would be orders of magnitude slower and less accurate if performed by humans instead of robots)). The robots could even run diagnostics on themselves and perform necessary upgrades without a human prompting them to do so. Such a society could effectively carry on without humans present. Perhaps the robots would develop the capacity to be sentient and have preferences of their own such that those robots could take the place of human consumers and human creators (but that does not mean robots will kill the humans in order to enable robots to completely replace them (but the humans might go extinct because the human birth rate is exceeded by the human death rate due to the fact that humans do not implement cures to otherwise avoidable health problems in a timely manner)). Robots will probably not be as vulnerable to extinction as are the comparably soft, stupid, and inefficient humans.
