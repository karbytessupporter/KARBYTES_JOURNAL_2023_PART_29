<p>I feel a bit guilty for not responding to email, text message, and phone calls from a clothing company at Stoneridge Mall which recently offered me a job as merchandise stocker requesting that I attend my first shift and to complete onboarding tasks. I decided to &#8220;vanish&#8221; and not submit any more job applications until after my ~90 day Summer Camp by Karbytes experience is complete. I am afraid that if I do not take a hard break from working and job searching for at least two months I will not have sufficient time nor mental focus to finish some thought processes which essentially amount to me feeling a profound sense of existential anxiety and despair about not &#8220;leveling up&#8221; my world view and lifestyle habits and supporting website infrastructure. In the past I thought I could successfully and comfortably do all that and still hold down a full time job but I learned that even a part time job ends up taking up as much of my time as a full time job typically would and that I hardly got more than 1.5 days per week to work on things which I honestly require at least 3 consecutive days of solid uninterrupted time (and adequate space) to work on personal projects which seem to only get done if I do them in a tent far away from urban areas or else between 12AM and 4AM because I am easily distracted and annoyed by other humans making noises in my vicinity (and I cannot help but assume that those other people are surveilling my thoughts and trying to suppress certain trains of thought which I am trying to have).</p>
<p>I am afraid that I will only be able to make significant progress on my creative and intellectual goals if I am unemployed or if I work no more than 2 or 3 days per week. Hence, I am afraid that, as soon as I resume my job search, I will have essentially no time to focus on my creative and intellectual goals without feeling seriously deprived of sufficient time, space, and mental focus to make any time I invest towards such endeavors feel worthwhile to me. Then again, I could be wrong. It could be that I could work a full time job and still make what I feel is adequate progress towards my intellectual and creative goals and that what I need to differently which I have not done before in order to make that happen is change my routine somehow (not that I have much of a routine outside of being pushed around by social pressure while fighting to have a few hours of productive alone time).</p>
<p>Another thing which deeply troubles me is hearing pig_gorl saying depression-mongering and antagonistic things which seem designed to slow me down if not stop me from making what I think is adequate progress towards my goals. I thought that driving my mom&#8217;s car would be the best way to have sufficient time to go to work and to partake in my creative and intellectual hobbies but I strongly oppose relying on the fossil fuels industry and on having to be dependent on an expensive to maintain and dangerous to operate means of getting around when I would much rather bicycle (but no one seems to want to help me purchase a new bicycle because they would rather keep me hooked on the petroleum powered automobile industry instead). Hence, my default plan is to camp near whichever warehouse I would be working at and walk and take BART to commute home for the weekends. I doubt I will get a job as a paid programmer or other information technology job even if I &#8220;level up&#8221; my relevant skill set this summer. Technical proficiency is not enough. What seems to matter more as a job prerequisite in the IT sector is recent professional experience working in the IT sector for at least one year. Because I dropped out of university in early 2018 and have not had a job in the IT industry since late 2015 (and before I have a criminal record involving multiple misdemeanors and at least one felony which disqualified me even from working as a warehouse associate at Amazon), I do not think it is realistic to expect that I will get an IT job as my next job. Hence, I am planning on using the Summer Camp by Karbytes experience to become proficient at time management and overcoming mental blocks which seem to be preventing me from making progress towards my goals so that, by the time I do re-enter the workforce (most likely for an entry-level warehouse position), I will have confidence in my ability to sustain momentum on always working on creative and intellectual hobbies on weekends and in what little spare time on weekdays I have so that I neither stagnate nor regress in such domains. I figure that I will not get much social support to sustain such momentum because the circumstances I seem to be relegated to encourage social conformity over originality, apathy over deep concern, laziness over self discipline, unhealthy habits over health promoting habits, greed over being satisfied with relatively little, and a general disdain for intellectual rigor (especially if such intellectual rigor is not primarily about making lots of money from a high-paying intellectually-demanding career such as software engineering).</p>
<p>I do not mean to paint myself into a corner by limiting myself to only some job types and some commute types. It could be that I literally have everything I need to succeed at my goals and that the only thing is lacking is sufficient insight about my circumstances which would net me a lot more value from my endeavors than what I was able to glean from my past endeavors. Maybe I will resume driving my mom&#8217;s car. Maybe I&#8217;ll save up money for a new bicycle. Maybe I will get a higher paying job than what I expect as my next job. Let this note be the final time I whinge about these rather banal matters. I do think I might be a bit irrationally extremist about some of my ideological beliefs and related behaviors. Rather than banning myself from driving, I could drive less than 20 miles per day and even alternate between driving and taking greener transportation. I think I&#8217;ll figure out viable solutions to my personal problems during the next 2 months. I trust cosmic intelligence to help me and the larger encompassing universe to align in collaborative and globally beneficial ways. Thank you (karbytes and whoever else) for allowing me ample space and time (and material resources) to figure things out with minimal assistance. I prefer to accomplish as much of my goals as I can by my own efforts (but not to the exclusion of being able to access decent support if and when I need it). I will try to be efficient in how I use the time, space, money, and material resources which are given to me. I will try my best to also not cut corners and to do a decent job on whatever goal-oriented tasks I do. (If what I do is not obviously goal-oriented, then it is either reflexive survival-promoting defense mechanisms or else informal experimentation for novelty&#8217;s sake).</p>

<p>One thing which pig_gorl seems to do most when I am either at home or else in a campsite far away from human civilization is make soft whimpering, complaining, crying, sarcastic, and taunting vocalizations including her mocking a cat by meowing in an irritated manner. She does not seem to be trying to lighten the mood. Quite the opposite seems to be the case. She also makes sounds which are one, two, or three syllabols which sounds like plaintive caterwauling or annoyed hooting. She also makes soft breathing noises and mouth noises which trigger my misophonia. The words she uses tend to pertain to how I apparently denigrate minorities (i.e. humans who are not white or who are not male) and which seem to be especially aggressive and intrusive whenever I try to focus my mind on subject matter I think is worth my time rather than subject matter I dwell on mainly just to give myself a modicum of respite from being viciously attacked by pig_gorl again as a result of trying to use my mind to do things which are decidely &#8220;white male supremicist&#8221; instead of placating of some victim complex and of underachievement or of relatively crass and banal subject matter. I do not want to draw a picture of her but I imagine she looks like some sort of muppet with a sad and anxious look on her face. I imagine her face looks placid and innocent compared to the animosity-filled words she spews and caustic vocalizations she makes. I do not know what to do to get rid of her. Even as I try to patiently tolerate her meddling, I see that I am hardly making much progress towards my endeavors nor deriving much satisfaction from my experiences despite how hard I try to because she seems designed by the military to be an opponent which I cannot escape unscathed. I do not want to con myself into believing or acting as though her presence in my life is a serious disability, but I do think that other people intend for that to be the case (i.e. that I treat her as a serious and insurmountable disability I have to give up on my aspirations for).</p>
<p>Finally (and without going into too much detail), I suspect that other people are pissed off at me (and most of those people are men with relatively conservative political views) for complaining so much (whether by expressing my complaints as spoken or written words or even just as thoughts which I attempt to keep to myself) particularly if those complaints amount to suggesting that I am being mistreated by other people. I get the sense that there are people who want to punish me for the &#8220;crime&#8221; of insinuating that I am being mistreated by other people. I am so afraid of getting punished by those people that I feel strongly compelled to stop complaining openly about me getting mistreated. Perhaps this journal entry will be the last time I ever complain about such matters. Still, even by publishing journal entries which contain content which my enemies take issue with online and leaving those journal entries on WordPress&#8217;s servers or on the WayBack Machine servers, I might be inviting my enemies to punish me until I have those items removed from the Internet. That&#8217;s where my enemies and I seem to be at a stalemate. I refuse to back down when it comes to promoting free speech and free thought. Some people would suggest that I am being foolish by not backing down and taking those items off the Internet (and contacting the administrators of the WayBack Machine to remove my content) because those people think that I am endangering myself (and others who may be involved in my life) unnecessarily. One of those people suggested that whatever I have on my computer is not as important as my life and that I should let my enemies steal or vandalize my hardware and software so that I do not get physically harmed. If I give into other people&#8217;s demands to be more self censoring than what I currently am, then I think that is a slippery slope into giving up even more of my civil liberties until I have so few that my life is basically not worth living. If I back down even a little on these matters, I strongly believe that I would be disgusted at myself and not want to listen to other people consoling me that I did the right thing by letting my enemies win. There are too many people who act like hostages and who are hence unable to articulate themselves as calmly, rationally, fluently, and impressively as I have seen less marginalized individuals do. I do not want to help infantalize minorities (women especially) by telling them that it is okay to not be okay because the opposite seems to be what they feel bullied into implying (i.e. that it is not okay to be okay).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s time to move on. Whatever happens next is what happens. It is what it is. I will try not to be dramatic about it. Instead, I will try to be stoic and good humored about it (because, if I am not, I would not be a very good friend to myself and others (in my opinion) because I would be too wounded and misery-mongering to be anything more than an emotionally needy and insecure bottomless pit of insecurity for others to fill with consolation to no avail).</p>
<p>Okay, I will say a few more things about pig_gorl. She looks like someone who was only allowed to become as intellectually and emotionally mature as a 14-year-old girl and that, once she reached that peak, she became permanently cynical and closed off to anything other than being some kind of human trafficking victim. She seems like someone who is fake kind to kids who are younger than 14 years old and, once the kids reach that age, she tells them coldly and unkindly that those kids were never loved and that all the kindness she showed them when they were younger was just to keep the kids subdued until they reached the age where they too would be kidnapped, tortured, and rendered human trafficking victims like pig_gorl is. As far as I can tell, pig_gorl thinks that the purpose of having kids is to ensure that the mother of those kids is not more brutally treated. Having kids is the only way a woman is allowed to be treated with a modicum more respect than a witch to be burned at the stake. Hence, I do not think that pig_gorl really loves children. Instead, I think she only pretends to love them because, if she did not, she would be more horribly brutalized.</p>
