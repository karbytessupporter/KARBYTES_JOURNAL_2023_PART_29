<p>I set up my tent again at the same location I have been camping at the past few days. The location is in a forest near Lake Chabot and relatively secluded (though people have occasionally hiked past my tent during daylight hours. At night I seem to be the only human present within a quarter mile radius). It is shortly after sunset and the daylight is fading and the air temperature is decreasing. I read some articles online about lobotomy and decided to confess some things which I intend to not repeat: I was involuntarily hospitalized at mental hospitals for unruly behavior between the years 2016 and 2018. I do not think that I was ever truly mentally ill (i.e. that I had no permanently disabling brain abnormalities such as schizophrenia). Also, I believe that most psychiatric diagnoses are arbitrary labels designed to derive money from patients and to pathologize cultural nonconformist adaptation strategies. I believe that depression is a choice and/or an evolutionary response to an individual perceiving itself to not be sufficiently important to its encompassing society to demand more investment from its encompassing society. Depression seems to be a way of conserving energy and not being a public burden. Mania seems to be the opposite strategy; to save oneself from being forced to atrophy or otherwise be limited as a result of cultural conditioning and social hierarchies. Even schizophrenia seems to be just another way of filtering information which is atypical but nevertheless just as valid as other ways of filtering information. I do not want to waste too much time talking about various classification of brain structure and brain functioning types nor their &#8220;cures&#8221; and, instead, emphasize that I think that each individual nervous system is too unique and should hence be treated as perfect in its own regard rather than to try to force brains to assimilate to some standard. Lastly, I am afraid that some people are deliberately trying to wear me down and cause me to &#8220;go insane&#8221; so that they can call 911 on me and have me committed to a mental hospital, forced to be chemically lobotomized, and relegated to a marginalized part of society so that I am unable to be influential as an intellectual and creative.</p>
<p>I think that the best way to prevent myself from &#8220;going insane&#8221; (i.e. getting carried away with maladaptive coping strategies) is to prefrontal cortex with logical exercises such as mathematics, computer programming, and counting. Perhaps that is why some people seem so opposed to me making a habit of vigorously and routinely exercising my logical brain. Perhaps those people know that such exercise would keep me from getting committed to a mental hospital and relegated to the shadows where those people want me to be metaphorically buried alive, dismissed as lacking in intellectual credibility, and forgotten about. Why else would I be spending so much time hiding in the wilderness away from &#8220;civilization&#8221;? I am not really here to enjoy the scenic vistas nor soothing birdsong nor even to gaze up into the starry night sky and wax philosophical about the mysteries and depths of the cosmos. I am here to devise and to implement self preservation strategies so that I have a chance of saving my mind from being obliterated and forced to be retarded and miserable by those who seem to want to force me to assimilate to a dumbed down, stressed out, and socially conformist civilization.</p>
<p>It could be that what I am saying in this journal entry is melodramatic. It could be that I am merely venting or even being satirical. Some people might construe my writings as serious threats to commit physical harm to myself and others. At the risk of getting punished for speaking my mind and acting in ways which are not exactly pleasing to others nor socially conformist, I will keep doing what I feel inspired to do and what makes me feel integrous, authentic, and self-befriending (because if I do not, I think I would rather quickly and painlessly end my life).</p>
<p>Well, I hope y&#8217;all can see that I do not merely want to study STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subject matter just to &#8220;impress the ladies&#8221; or to get a high-paying job. I am mostly doing it in order to help myself avoid falling into depression and other maladaptive ways of operating. I am doing it so that I can feel more gratitude, self esteem, and other permutations of pleasure than I otherwise would. I find having an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex to be a disturbing waste of human potential which I think not enough humans are serously worried enough about to prevent in themselves. Finally, I will be more interested in socializing and in participating in organized humanitarian causes if and when I think that a sufficiently high number of sufficiently intelligent (and STEM-proficient) humans exist. Right now, I think too many &#8220;dumb dumbs&#8221; exist for me to feel that my efforts to be some kind of political activist or socialite are worth my time and energy. I would rather not try to influence other people because I think people are generally too close minded to appreciate what I have to say and because I think people would rather waste my time by picking fights with me and escalating those fights. I would rather let other people misunderstand and underapprecaite me than desperately try to get them to see me the way I want them to and to treat me the way I want them to. I can tell people what my ethics are. I can tell people what my preferences are. I can create great works of art. But people will ultimately pay attention only to what they want to and do only what they want to. If I end up being the only person who appreciates and understands my work as a creative and intellectual, then at least I have myself to provide such validation. My own validation is sufficient for me to feel motivated to continue expanding my STEM knowledge and skills. My personal websites (Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) are what I consider to be my most cherished and important legacy and medium of self expression and ego reinforcement. I consider working on those websites to be among my highest priorities if not my highest priority. (My highest priority is probably the preservation of my physical health and bodily autonomy and survival though the building and preservation of my websites might be just as important to me).</p>
