As a corollary to what I said last night, I am all for allowing XX chromosomed humans (and humans with crippling genetic defects) to go extinct in favor of only allowing XY chromosomed individuals to be generated using gametes which are derived from healthy XY chromosomed humans and/or computer generated gamete components (especially computer optimized genomes) and artificial wombs to incubate the resulting fetuses until those fetuses are mature enough to leave those gestation pods. The timing and quantity of such production would be determined by population size optimization functions and by the desire of existing adult humans. If there is insufficient human demand for generating new humans, then production of new humans will cease until there is both sufficient human desire for creating new humans and the results of technocratic calculations suggest there is sufficient room in civilization space to introduce new humans to the system. After emerging from the gestation pods, newborn humans will be kept in nursery orphanages. Eligible human adults could adopt up to three children from those nursery orphanages. If a child is not adopted by the time it reaches three years of age, that child will be raised in a state run boarding school until it reaches legal adult age. 

I am all for XX chromosomed humans going extinct as a result of each of them dying by suicide or from unplanned causes such as disease and accidents if the means to extend a human's individual lifespan indefinitely are either not available to all humans or else if humans voluntarily opt out of life extension medical treatments. 

Suppose all humans opt for life extending medical treatments. Then I am for allowing each human to live for as long as it wants to and, if a significant number of those humans end up dying, then I am for only generating new humans according to the specifications I described in the first paragraph. Hence, if all the existing humans end up dying, then only XY humans without crippling genetic defects will replace those humans if a sufficiently high demand by existing humans to continue generating new humans existed prior to those existing humans dying. Otherwise, all existing humans would not be replaced by new humans due to a lack of human demand or due to artificial intelligence calculating that conditions would be inhospitable to future human life.
