If I spend lots of time explaining my ideas out loud, pig_gorl eventually interjects with condescending phrases, non sequiturs, and rhetorical questions such as, "Why is your mouth moving?" Her goal seems to be to make me feel unheard, unappreciated, and cut off. I feel that I have only done 1% of the work I feel is necessary to reach my goals and that pig_gorl thinks even that 1% is more than I should ever accomplish in a lifetime. 

What I was talking about was how I think capitalism, socialism, and democracy are what make society worth living in. Capitalism enables me to acquire the products and services I want without having to ingratiate myself to whoever the providers of those commodities are using the same number of interchangeable monetary tokens as any other buyer would use such that one buyer is not favored over any buyer in terms of that buyer's ideological or lifestyle preferences (though commercial sellers are legally entitled to give preferential treatment to some buyers over other buyers). Socialism makes up for such favoritism by ensuring that every citizen has access to basic commodities such as food, housing, and medical care (and such commodities are typically paid for by taxes gleaned from some percentage of the profits earned by commercial sellers of supplementary commodities). Finally, democracy enables each citizen to contribute the same degree of influence as every other citizen over what the rules of its society are by submitting petitions for rule changes with sufficiently many signatures from individual citizens or by periodically allowing each citizen to specify their preferences on a voting ballot which is initially identical to every other ballot and then submitting those ballots so that all the ballots can be read and the most popular preferences will be enforced as governing policies.
