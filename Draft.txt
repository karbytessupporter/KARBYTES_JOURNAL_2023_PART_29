I feel a bit guilty for not responding to email, text message, and phone calls from a clothing company at Stoneridge Mall which recently offered me a job as merchandise stocker requesting that I attend my first shift and to complete onboarding tasks. I decided to "vanish" and not submit any more job applications until after my ~90 day Summer Camp by Karbytes experience is complete. I am afraid that if I do not take a hard break from working and job searching for at least two months I will not have sufficient time nor mental focus to finish some thought proceses which essentially amount to me feeling a profound sense of existential anxiety and despair about not "leveling up" my world view and lifestyle habits and supporting website infrastructure. In the past I thought I could successfully and comfortably do all that and still hold down a full time job but I learned that even a part time job ends up taking up as much of my time as a full time job typically would and that I hardly got more than 1.5 days per week to work on things which I honestly require at least 3 consecutive days of solid uninterrupted time (and adequate space) to work on personal projects which seem to only get done if I do them in a tent far away from urban areas or else between 12AM and 4AM because I am easily distracted and annoyed by other humans making noises in my vicinity (and I cannot help but assume that those other people are surveilling my thoughts and trying to suppress certain trains of thought which I am trying to have). 

I am afraid that I will only be able to make significant progress on my creative and intellectual goals if I am unemployed or if I work no more than 2 or 3 days per week. Hence, I am afraid that, as soon as I resume my job search, I will have essentially no time to focus on my creative and intellectual goals without feeling seriously deprived of sufficient time, space, and mental focus to make any time I invest towards such endeavors feel worthwhile to me. Then again, I could be wrong. It could be that I could work a full time job and still make what I feel is adequate progress towards my intellectual and creative goals and that what I need to differently which I have not done before in order to make that happen is change my routine somehow (not that I have much of a routine outside of being pushed around by social pressure while fighting to have a few hours of productive alone time).

Another thing which deeply troubles me is hearing pig_gorl saying depression-mongering and antagonistic things which seem designed to slow me down if not stop me from making what I think is adequate progress towards my goals. I thought that driving my mom's car would be the best way to have sufficient time to go to work and to partake in my creative and intellectual hobbies but I strongly oppose relying on the fossil fuels industry and on having to be dependent on an expensive to maintain and dangerous to operate means of getting around when I would much rather bicycle (but no one seems to want to help me purchase a new bicycle because they would rather keep me hooked on the petroleum powered automobile industry instead). Hence, my default plan is to camp near whichever warehouse I would be working at and walk and take BART to commute home for the weekends. I doubt I will get a job as a paid programmer or other information technology job even if I "level up" my relevant skill set this summer. Technical proficiency is not enough. What seems to matter more as a job prerequisite in the IT sector is recent professional experience working in the IT sector for at least one year. Because I dropped out of university in early 2018 and have not had a job in the IT industry since late 2015 (and before I have a criminal record involving multiple misdemeanors and at least one felony which disqualified me even from working as a warehouse associate at Amazon), I do not think it is realistic to expect that I will get an IT job as my next job. Hence, I am planning on using the Summer Camp by Karbytes experience to become proficient at time management and overcoming mental blocks which seem to be preventing me from making progress towards my goals so that, by the time I do re-enter the workforce (most likely for an entry-level warehouse position), I will have confidence in my ability to sustain momentum on always working on creative and intellectual hobbies on weekends and in what little spare time on weekdays I have so that I neither stagnate nor regress in such domains. I figure that I will not get much social support to sustain such momentum because the circumstances I seem to be relegated to encourage social conformity over originality, apathy over deep concern, laziness over self discipline, unhealthy habits over health promoting habits, greed over being satisfied with relatively little, and a general disdain for intellectual rigor (especially if such intellectual rigor is not primarily about making lots of money from a high-paying intellectually-demanding career such as software engineering).

I do not mean to paint myself into a corner by limiting myself to only some job types and some commute types. It could be that I literally have everything I need to succeed at my goals and that the only thing is lacking is sufficient insight about my circumstances which would net me a lot more value from my endeavors than what I was able to glean from my past endeavors. Maybe I will resume driving my mom's car. Maybe I'll save up money for a new bicycle. Maybe I will get a higher paying job than what I expect as my next job. Let this note be the final time I whinge about these rather banal matters. I do think I might be a bit irrationally extremist about some of my ideological beliefs and related behaviors. Rather than banning myself from driving, I could drive less than 20 miles per day and even alternate between driving and taking greener transportation. I think I'll figure out viable solutions to my personal problems during the next 2 months. I trust cosmic intelligence to help me and the larger encompassing universe to align in collaborative and globally beneficial ways. Thank you (karbytes and whoever else) for allowing me ample space and time (and material resources) to figure things out with minimal assistance. I prefer to accomplish as much of my goals as I can by my own efforts (but not to the exclusion of being able to access decent support if and when I need it). I will try to be efficient in how I use the time, space, money, and material resources which are given to me. I will try my best to also not cut corners and to do a decent job on whatever goal-oriented tasks I do. (If what I do is not obviously goal-oriented, then it is either reflexive survival-promoting defense mechanisms or else informal experimentation for novelty's sake).
