<p>If I spend lots of time explaining my ideas out loud, pig_gorl eventually interjects with condescending phrases, non sequiturs, and rhetorical questions such as, &#8220;Why is your mouth moving?&#8221; Her goal seems to be to make me feel unheard, unappreciated, and cut off. I feel that I have only done 1% of the work I feel is necessary to reach my goals and that pig_gorl thinks even that 1% is more than I should ever accomplish in a lifetime.</p>
<p>What I was talking about was how I think capitalism, socialism, and democracy are what make society worth living in. Capitalism enables me to acquire the products and services I want without having to ingratiate myself to whoever the providers of those commodities are using the same number of interchangeable monetary tokens as any other buyer would use such that one buyer is not favored over any buyer in terms of that buyer&#8217;s ideological or lifestyle preferences (though commercial sellers are legally entitled to give preferential treatment to some buyers over other buyers). <span style="background:#ffff00">Socialism makes up for such favoritism by ensuring that every citizen has access to basic commodities such as food, housing, and medical care (and such commodities are typically paid for by taxes gleaned from some percentage of the profits earned by commercial sellers of supplementary commodities).</span> Finally, democracy enables each citizen to contribute the same degree of influence as every other citizen over what the rules of its society are by submitting petitions for rule changes with sufficiently many signatures from individual citizens or by periodically allowing each citizen to specify their preferences on a voting ballot which is initially identical to every other ballot and then submitting those ballots so that all the ballots can be read and the most popular preferences will be enforced as governing policies.</p>

<p>One last thing: I think that as much of the essential labor of human civilization as possible should be outsourced to robots instead of continuing to be performed by humans. Corporations can still continue to provide commercial commodities which citizens supply a sufficiently high demand for and pay taxes from the profits earned by selling those commodities while significantly reducing the costs of production due to the fact that robots generally cost less to employ (and robots tend to be more efficient and perform work of a consistently high quality while humans tend to be orders of magnitude less efficient and perform orders of magnitude more poorly than the robot workers). <span style="background:#ffff00">Perhaps more than 90% of humans will opt out of the workforce in order to subsist entirely on government issued provisions (which are paid for by companies which mostly employ robots to do the essential labor for those companies such as manufacturing products, transporting those products, and analyzing metrics concerning the supply and demand of those products (and such analysis would be orders of magnitude slower and less accurate if performed by humans instead of robots)).</span> The robots could even run diagnostics on themselves and perform necessary upgrades without a human prompting them to do so. Such a society could effectively carry on without humans present. Perhaps the robots would develop the capacity to be sentient and have preferences of their own such that those robots could take the place of human consumers and human creators (but that does not mean robots will kill the humans in order to enable robots to completely replace them (but the humans might go extinct because the human birth rate is exceeded by the human death rate due to the fact that humans do not implement cures to otherwise avoidable health problems in a timely manner)). Robots will probably not be as vulnerable to extinction as are the comparably soft, stupid, and inefficient humans.</p>

<p>One last thing I would like to add to this journal entry is what remains of this paragraph: I have an uncomfortable suspicion that the past three generations of humans secretly (or not so secretly) concluded that they would be the last to enjoy a decent standard of living while their children and grandchildren were expected to all die from ecological collapse, economic collapse, or warfare. That&#8217;s why my generation (the millennials) seem to work so hard yet hardly be able to afford to pay for even the basics. I imagine that cynicism and/or apathy about humanity&#8217;s future is so pervasive in some populations that those people only give birth to unplanned babies as a result of reckless and drunken sex with people they did not ever plan on living with nor supporting economically and that Women Infant and Children checks from the government made such reckless breeding profitable. Once the children reach adolescence, the parents are legally entitled to kick those kids out of the house and leave them to fend for themselves in a savage urban jungle while the deadbeat parents carry on as though they never had children because they never really wanted those children and because they only kept those children for the duration of time in which they were entitled to receive free money from the government as a reward for having those kids. <span style="background:#ffff00">I think that overpopulation is mostly the result of unplanned pregnancies and a desire to get free money and other social benefits which would otherwise not be possible.</span> Finally (and related to an article I found yesterday about how Japan is making progress towards being able to grow human fetuses inside of artificial wombs using gametes derived from skin cells), those who disapprove of enabling human babies to be incubated inside of artificial wombs on the basis that doing so is &#8220;playing God&#8221; or otherwise &#8220;morally wrong&#8221; are implicitly condoning that women be raped and die as a result of labor complications. I am disgusted and dismayed at how so many humans are okay with women being used as mere means to the end of making more humans and providing men sexual gratification while those women are treated as slaves who are easy to exploit and disposable (as if a woman&#8217;s sentience is irrelevant). I think such callous disregard of women&#8217;s sentience coincides with apathy about saving the environment and sparing other animals from the suffering of being held captive and painfully slaughtered so that humans have tasty meat or pretty furs to harvest. I also think that many humans are okay with the human species going extinct because they only care about themselves. Its like saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna die someday. Once I die, I won&#8217;t care about whether anyone else lives or dies (but I prefer that everyone dies so that I don&#8217;t have to miss out on what would otherwise be human existence without me). If I don&#8217;t get to travel to other galaxies and have super powers as a result of advanced prosthetics which do not exist yet, I don&#8217;t want anyone else to either. Hence, I&#8217;m all for using up the last of Earth&#8217;s resources and rendering Earth uninhabitable for humans who get to live after me.&#8221;</p>
