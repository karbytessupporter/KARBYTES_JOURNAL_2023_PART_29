<p>At the risk of sounding melodramatic, I will admit that I feel very uncomfortable &#8220;going to school&#8221; unless I am secluded away from other people because, in recent memory, whenever I planned on sitting down to work on intellectually rigorous tasks (relatively speaking (and computer programming projects in particular)), people other than myself seemed to get upset and do things repeatedly which seemed passive aggressive and deliberately distracting and even hurtful so that I would not proceed with my projects. If I lived in a house or apartment by myself, I think I would absolutely love going to school and working remotely. I&#8217;m afraid that other people who live in my household or close by are trying to prevent me from having a thriving remote work or study routine (perhaps because those people are afraid that I will &#8220;snap&#8221; and commit vandalism or domestic violence as a result of being under &#8220;too much pressure&#8221;). If what I say is true, then I have a legitimate reason to be distressed about my living situation and to claim that other people are severely intrusive and disruptive to my preferred way of life. Otherwise, I am simply being paranoid and have yet to get into a comfortable and sustainable routine which allows me to make what I think is reasonable progress towards my personal goals. (It could be that other people are insecure about me studying because doing so makes them feel underaccomplished, undereducated, and not as free to do their own thing as I am to do mine. I seem to be living near a lot of people who believe that I should be deprived of privacy and cut off from having interests that are not inclusive of those around me).</p>
