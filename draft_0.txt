One thing which pig_gorl seems to do most when I am either at home or else in a campsite far away from human civilization is make soft whimpering, complaining, crying, sarcastic, and taunting vocalizations including her mocking a cat by meowing in an irritated manner. She does not seem to be trying to lighten the mood. Quite the opposite seems to be the case. She also makes sounds which are one, two, or three syllabols which sounds like plaintive caterwauling or annoyed hooting. She also makes soft breathing noises and mouth noises which trigger my misophonia. The words she uses tend to pertain to how I apparently denigrate minorities (i.e. humans who are not white or who are not male) and which seem to be especially aggressive and intrusive whenever I try to focus my mind on subject matter I think is worth my time rather than subject matter I dwell on mainly just to give myself a modicum of respite from being viciously attacked by pig_gorl again as a result of trying to use my mind to do things which are decidely "white male supremicist" instead of placating of some victim complex and of underachievement or of relatively crass and banal subject matter. I do not want to draw a picture of her but I imagine she looks like some sort of muppet with a sad and anxious look on her face. I imagine her face looks placid and innocent compared to the animosity-filled words she spews and caustic vocalizations she makes. I do not know what to do to get rid of her. Even as I try to patiently tolerate her meddling, I see that I am hardly making much progress towards my endeavors nor deriving much satisfaction from my experiences despite how hard I try to because she seems designed by the military to be an opponent which I cannot escape unscathed. I do not want to con myself into believing or acting as though her presence in my life is a serious disability, but I do think that other people intend for that to be the case (i.e. that I treat her as a serious and insurmountable disability I have to give up on my aspirations for).

Finally (and without going into too much detail), I suspect that other people are pissed off at me (and most of those people are men with relatively conservative political views) for complaining so much (whether by expressing my complaints as spoken or written words or even just as thoughts which I attempt to keep to myself) particularly if those complaints amount to suggesting that I am being mistreated by other people. I get the sense that there are people who want to punish me for the "crime" of insinuating that I am being mistreated by other people. I am so afraid of getting punished by those people that I feel strongly compelled to stop complaining openly about me getting mistreated. Perhaps this journal entry will be the last time I ever complain about such matters. Still, even by publishing journal entries which contain content which my enemies take issue with online and leaving those journal entries on WordPress's servers or on the WayBack Machine servers, I might be inviting my enemies to punish me until I have those items removed from the Internet. That's where my enemies and I seem to be at a stalemate. I refuse to back down when it comes to promoting free speech and free thought. Some people would suggest that I am being foolish by not backing down and taking those items off the Internet (and contacting the administrators of the WayBack Machine to remove my content) because those people think that I am endangering myself (and others who may be involved in my life) unnecessarily. One of those people suggested that whatever I have on my computer is not as important as my life and that I should let my enemies steal or vandalize my hardware and software so that I do not get physically harmed. If I give into other people's demands to be more self censoring than what I currently am, then I think that is a slippery slope into giving up even more of my civil liberties until I have so few that my life is basically not worth living. If I back down even a little on these matters, I strongly believe that I would be disgusted at myself and not want to listen to other people consoling me that I did the right thing by letting my enemies win. There are too many people who act like hostages and who are hence unable to articulate themselves as calmly, rationally, fluently, and impressively as I have seen less marginalized individuals do. I do not want to help infantalize minorities (women especially) by telling them that it is okay to not be okay because the opposite seems to be what they feel bullied into implying (i.e. that it is not okay to be okay).

That's it. It's time to move on. Whatever happens next is what happens. It is what it is. I will try not to be dramatic about it. Instead, I will try to be stoic and good humored about it (because, if I am not, I would not be a very good friend to myself and others (in my opinion) because I would be too wounded and misery-mongering to be anything more than an emotionally needy and insecure bottomless pit of insecurity for others to fill with consolation to no avail).

Okay, I will say a few more things about pig_gorl. She looks like someone who was only allowed to become as intellectually and emotionally mature as a 14-year-old girl and that, once she reached that peak, she became permanently cynical and closed off to anything other than being some kind of human traficking victim. She seems like someone who is fake kind to kids who are younger than 14 years old and, once the kids reach that age, she tells them coldly and unkindly that those kids were never loved and that all the kindness she showed them when they were younger was just to keep the kids subdued until they reached the age where they too would be kidnapped, tortured, and rendered human traficking victims like pig_gorl is. As far as I can tell, pig_gorl thinks that the purpose of having kids is to ensure that the mother of those kids is not more brutally treated. Having kids is the only way a woman is allowed to be treated with a modicum more respect than a witch to be burned at the stake. Hence, I do not think that pig_gorl really loves children. Instead, I think she only pretends to love them because, if she did not, she would be more horribly brutalized.
