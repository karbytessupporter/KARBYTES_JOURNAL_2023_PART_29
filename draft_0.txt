<span style="00ff00">When you don't haz science; at least you haz philosophy!" - karbytes</span>

The green highlighted  paragraph above has been sent off as a tweet on karbytes' Twitter page. The screenshot of that tweet is included below. <u>That tweet has also been deleted by karbytes from karbytes Twitter. That is because karbytes is trying to make its social media presence as streamlined and as succinct as possible.</u>

Just strike out that part. It's done.

<hr>

But it isn't done.  karbytes deleted that tweet whose content is identical to the string which is highlighted green in the page section above (because karbytes thinks that tweet is implying that only the rich can do science while the poor are left with only philosophy in which to exercise their minds).
