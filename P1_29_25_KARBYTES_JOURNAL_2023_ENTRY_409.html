<p>Today I made some updates to the web paged named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/epistemology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EPISTEMOLOGY</a> in my primary website (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>). One of the changes I made was adding hyperlinks to relevant Wikipedia pages next to each one of the italicized paragraphs.</p>
<p>While I was making those updates, pig_gorl was making snarky and disinterested comments constantly in the background. I think that pig_gorl is staunchly opposed to studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and would rather exclusively dwell on psychology and sociology from the perspective of a non-academic sensationalist news seeker. I figure that there is not much I can do about pig_gorl other than to just tolerate her presence while doing my best to not call attention to her nor to use her as an excuse not to focus on my endeavors.</p>
<p>Another thing I was thinking about doing relatively soon is working on a simple C++ program which approximates Euler&#8217;s number (because I already made a working application which does that last year) as a &#8220;warmup&#8221; to building my own version of the cmath pow() function for computing powers using real number bases and real number exponents.</p>
<p>Finally, I have been downloading some YouTube videos from channels like Theories of Everything with Curt Jaimungal and Lex Fridman to listen to offline when I crave pleasant and interesting conversations to listen to (especially when relaxing in my tent and settling down before I go to sleep).</p>
<p>One thing which I appreciate is how Brea the cat has followed me into the garage to curl up on the saw table seemingly because she enjoys my company (and not just because I give her food and open doors for her). I let her out through the garage door multiple times tonight but she keeps coming back inside. She also seems to really like smelling my feet and laying on top of them when I stand barefoot in the kitchen.</p>
