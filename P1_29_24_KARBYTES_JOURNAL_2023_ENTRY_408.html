<p>As a corollary to <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_407/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what I said last night</a>, I am all for allowing XX chromosomed humans (and humans with crippling genetic defects) to go extinct in favor of only allowing XY chromosomed individuals to be generated using gametes which are derived from healthy XY chromosomed humans and/or computer generated gamete components (especially computer optimized genomes) and artificial wombs to incubate the resulting fetuses until those fetuses are mature enough to leave those gestation pods. The timing and quantity of such production would be determined by population size optimization functions and by the desire of existing adult humans. If there is insufficient human demand for generating new humans, then production of new humans will cease until there is both sufficient human desire for creating new humans and the results of technocratic calculations suggest there is sufficient room in civilization space to introduce new humans to the system. After emerging from the gestation pods, newborn humans will be kept in nursery orphanages. Eligible human adults could adopt up to three children from those nursery orphanages. If a child is not adopted by the time it reaches three years of age, that child will be raised in a state run boarding school until it reaches legal adult age.</p>
<p>I am all for XX chromosomed humans going extinct as a result of each of them dying by suicide or from unplanned causes such as disease and accidents if the means to extend a human&#8217;s individual lifespan indefinitely are either not available to all humans or else if humans voluntarily opt out of life extension medical treatments.</p>
<p>Suppose all humans opt for life extending medical treatments. Then I am for allowing each human to live for as long as it wants to and, if a significant number of those humans end up dying, then I am for only generating new humans according to the specifications I described in the first paragraph. Hence, if all the existing humans end up dying, then only XY humans without crippling genetic defects will replace those humans if a sufficiently high demand by existing humans to continue generating new humans existed prior to those existing humans dying. Otherwise, all existing humans would not be replaced by new humans due to a lack of human demand or due to artificial intelligence calculating that conditions would be inhospitable to future human life.</p>

<p>I would also like to add that, in addition to the societal conditions I described in the previous paragraphs, XX chromosomed humans who remain in such a society as vestigial members will be forbidden from getting pregnant (and if they become  pregnant, they will be detained and forced to undergo abortion if the pregnancy is sufficiently &#8220;early term&#8221; or else give birth if the pregnancy is later term while in prison). If the pregnancy was determined by the technocracy to have been caused by the XX chromosomed human getting raped (or as a result of sterilization surgery failing to be effective at blocking the passage of gametes), then that human individual will only be held in prison as long as it takes to either perform the abortion or else deliver the baby. If the pregnancy was determined by the technocracy to have been caused by the pregnant human by that pregnant human&#8217;s own volition, then the human will be incarcerated for up to five years in prison and forced to undergo tubal ligation as a means to discourage humans from becoming voluntarily pregnant in the future. Also, any humans (or sufficiently intelligent agents) who were determined by the technocracy to have committed rape will be incarcerated for up to ten years and forcibly undergo either <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubal_ligation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tubal litigation</a> or else a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasectomy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vasectomy</a> if they have reproductive organs.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Finally, any human citizen (whether incarcerated or not) is encouraged to get an entirely state subsidized sterilization procedure performed on itself. Regardless of whether or not a human citizen is determined by the state to be a criminal, any sterilization procedure that human citizen undergoes is designed to be minimally invasive and irreversible. Basically, the sterilization surgeries amount to fallopian tube clamping (or fallopian tube removal) or vas deferens clamping (or vas deferens removal). Both procedures prevent gametes from passing through those tubes with over 99% effectiveness. Also, each citizen is legally entitled to state funded health care and freedom from unwarranted violence and torture. The only legal violence and torture permitted are short-term incapacitation means deployed by law enforcement to safely detain criminal suspects and to keep further violence from erupting. Retribution is not the aim of law enforcement. Harm prevention is the only aim of law enforcement.</p>
