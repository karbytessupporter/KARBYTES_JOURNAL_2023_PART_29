I had a dream which I woke up from within the past half hour in which I was walking down a quiet suburban street shortly before sunrise which had a bunch of small cottages for guests to rent. I saw a cottage which appeared to only consist of a bedroom and a bathroom and saw that it was unlocked and walked in thinking I could sneak a stay for free. I walked into the bathroom which had an electrical outlet on the floor and a greed light emitting diode on it, closed the bathroom door, and laid on the floor. Within five minutes, a woman approximately 60 years old wearing a red blouse and black pants and some guy approximately 30 years old were talking and walked into that cottage. I heard the man discussing with the woman about available cottages for rent. The man appeared to be looking at the various tiny houses for vacation rental while the woman was the property manager showing him around. They opened the bathroom door to find me lying on the floor in there and I immediately pretended in a light hearted manner to be that guy's friend and said something like, "What do you think of this one, mate? I already tested out the bathroom." They played along as if nothing was wrong and seemed happy. Then we went into the bedroom part of that cottage and I saw that it was then a tall room with a loft and a seating area underneath it. I was admiring out loud the many colorful hand made glass decorations hanging from the ceiling and commented on how the fine craftsmanship involved using metal powders to create shimmering effects. Then I was standing outside that building telling my dad what happened like it was just part of some party I remember going to which was hosted by my parents' friends in some beautiful backyard in a rural setting like it was a casual barbecue celebration and people were standing around waiting for hotdogs and drinking beer and soft drinks from the cooler full of drinks and ice cubes. I woke up and started talking out loud about the events of that dream with my eyes closed at approximately 9AM in my tent in the forest while I was still somewhat in some partially dreaming state in order to preserve the details of that dream before they faded (because, as soon as I open my eyes to resume my waking life, I tend to quickly forget whatever my dream was about). Since waking up I have noticed pig_gorl making soft and incessant nagging sounds which sound like her trying to pick a fight with me. She sounds like a bitchy woman on her period who cannot wait to pull me out of whatever  pleasant or interesting experience I was immersed in to resume intently focusing on her and being made to suffer because she seems someone else to suffer with her because she never seems to stop complaining or fretting and seems opposed to me having even a modicum of enjoyment in life. A video recording I made which sounds like how pig_gorl has been nag-whimpering since I woke up is available in journal entry # x of the year 2023.
