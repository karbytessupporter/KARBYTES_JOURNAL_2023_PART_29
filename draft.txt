The three tweets which are depicted in the screenshots below have been deleted because their author thinks those tweets are rather aimless compared to the tweets which that author made approximately two days ago about the purpose of its blog and what that author thinks is a decent summary of human civilization's main fault. The tweets depicted on this web page serve as hints to what might be considered relevant subject matter according to karbytes (and karbytes is an information processing agent attempting to continually refine its function for determining whether some informational input is sufficiently relevant to karbytes (i.e. worthwhile for karbytes to spend its cognitive resources on) or else not sufficiently relevant to karbytes (i.e. not worthwhile for karbytes to spend its cognitive resources on). It is assumed that karbytes only has a finite amount of cognitive resources (i.e. energy to run specific neural circuits inside of karbytes' brain) per finite time period. Therefore, karbytes is assumed to not be able to process all incoming informational inputs without running out of cognitive resources necessary to achieve karbytes' goals. Hence, in order for karbytes to achieve its goals, karbytes must ignore that which is not sufficiently relevant to karbytes' goal acquisition.
