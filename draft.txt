A biological woman has little to contribute to society other than her capacity to bare offspring, lactate, and provide sexual and emotional support to biological men. Meanwhile, a biological man is orders of magnitude more likely than a biological woman to contribute to society in terms of pragmatic knowledge and genuinely impressive artistic, intellectual, and athletic feats. That is because biological men have had more time to develop themselves physically and mentally for roles outside of merely birthing the next generation. While men converse in depth about solving complex engineering problems which have large scale implications on human civilization, women converse about loving oneself ad nauseum as though for the first time. While men go to the gym and read books in their spare time, women console themselves that it is okay and normal for them to gain weight from emotional eating and for their children to surpass them in terms of reading comprehension because women are not encouraged by society to do much other than be gold digging prostitutes who are too vain and self absorbed to become proficient at anything other than what it takes to survive at a bare minimum level. Women wear clothes and exhibit mannerisms which enhance the sexual dimorphism which results in women appearing to be stunted at the developmental level of children. Only boys seem to actually become physically and mentally mature while girls seem to get dumber and weaker as a result of puberty and cultural indoctrination. If it were not for women gaining an hourglass figure (more subcutaneous fat stores in the form of bulbuous tits, ass, and upper limbs) through puberty, women would physically resemble prepubescent girls. Such fat stores seem to be preserved as heritable traits because they were used as bartering chips by women to earn the protection and provision of men who could live without women (while women could not live without men because, unlike men, women were sexually selected to be physically weak as little girls). What I mean to suggest is that much of human nature is about making men the explorers, architects, warriors, doctors, and artists while making women little more than the proliferators of such. 

I don't think women have much to be proud of themselves for unless they work overtime to overcome the deficiencies which were instilled in them from sexual selection and cultural reinforcement. If women did what I suggested, there would be no gender roles and there may be no need to infantalize and cripple women just to ensure that there would be enough human capital on hand to sustain the human species for at least two more generations. I mean to suggest that women are effectively disabled unless they take testosterone in order to acquire normal muscle mass, bone density, stamina, and other physiological characteristics which are conducive to being human and not merely subhuman chattel. A biological woman with an in tact functional uterus could temporarily cease taking testosterone for approximately two years in order to conceive, incubate, and lactate biological offspring. What I am proposing is a world in which men and women are equal to each other in terms of physical strength and mental aptitude. In order for the disabling and unnecessary sexual dimorphism in humans to be eliminated short of genetic engineering, biological women should take testosterone during or shortly after puberty. I hope that the widespread and time honored tradition of fetishizing the retardation and hobbling of women loses popularity and more people become disgusted by it so that I don't have to keep pretending that I don't notice how lame and obnoxiously infantile women seem compared to men. I'm sick of flattering women so that they don't hurt themselves and others. I'm sick of lying to women that I find their retardation redeemable as anything but some kind of arcane outdated fetish.
