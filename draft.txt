I listened to some voice mail messages which seemed to arrive late in my voice mail box last night. I heard the voices of former colleagues from OnTrac and even got two callbacks from that company in response to me submitting job applications to get re-hired for the package handling position. (I was rightfully fired to too many unexcused absences from work. There were multiple days I decided not to show up thinking I would get away with it). I also listened to approximately ten more voice mail messages from other people inviting me to interview for warehouse (package handling and manufacturing) jobs I applied for on Indeed dot Com. That's good. After approximately 90 days into my Summer Camp by Karbytes experience (which is awesome, by three way), I might resume searching for a full-time warehouse job (even though such jobs are not sufficient to pay for my parents' real estate). I like those jobs and think they are ideal for my current lifestyle, circumstances, and temperament (even though such jobs only pay for me to subsist at my current level quite comfortably). I suspect that my parents and some other other are not okay with me not aspiring to pay for anyone other than myself and, hence, there are people trying to prevent me from doing anything other than take care of other people to the exclusion of being able to maintain and enhance my current lifestyle. Such people seem to want to deprive me of space, time, and economic resources by which to do my hobbies. Such people seem to want to interrupt me when I am working on solitary creative or academic projects. Such people seem to prefer I do nothing other than eat, sleep, shit, and do slave labor. Such people are the bane of my existence. Such people deserve free financial support from the government first because such people need it the most. They need it to come to their senses. Employ robots instead of them or else employ humans part time for such positions. People have been standing across the street bellowing caustically seemingly whenever my thoughts include triggering key words. I might be imagining that people are more deliberately involved in my life than they actually are. I think they are trying to suppress my thoughts by barraging me with distracting and combative content. It sounds like taunts. This is why I do not want to work for and with other humans. They steal so much from me and are frequently disrespectful and deliberately detrimental to my goals and quality of life. I hope ever human adult and emancipated minors soon gets a liveable and unconditional fixed monthly income from the government which is wholly or mostly paid for by taxes paid by corporations which employ artificial intelligence to do as much of the essential labor as possible. I hope that human civilization graduates completely from fossil fuels to sustainable energy production means. (I was gonna say more, but I would like to end this note on the topic of photovoltaics).
