To Whom It May Concern:

In some journal entries I have published on this website (especially during the past two weeks), I have attempted to address what law enforcement and what other people who seem to have the ability to oppress me (such as by stealing and vandalizing my equipment seemingly in order to prevent me from be too comfortable and too technologically endowed in the wilderness instead of forced to be in closer proximity to other people and more dependent on them) seem to want (and what they seem to want overall is to prevent me from making progress towards what they seem to think are elitist endeavors and to force me to play the role of a teenager who is no older than 17 or 18 years old being re-raised by people who seem to be much more authoritarian (rather than lasse faire) and culturally conservative (rather than culturally liberal) than those who actually raised me and who I still live with to this day. I wrote a lot of journal entry posts lately which seem to amount to me having to present myself as a bigot merely for not being more preoccupied with and culturally assimilated to racial minorities (especially to African Americans). I think law enforcement is trying to pit me against racial minorities by forcing me to listen to an abusive and annoying caricature of some black or hispanic woman so that tailor my self expression to that of some kind of white supremacist bigot. I hope my readers can "read between the lines" of what I have written to see that I was being brainwashed and tortured against my will by censorship mongering control freaks whose demographic details are unknown to me because they have the privilege of remaining anonymous disembodied voices I feel obliged to pretend are symptoms of schizophrenia just so that I do not annoy people by insisting that those disembodied voices I hear are from law enforcement using some kind of advanced military grade mind reading and mind infiltration technology. I think totalitarian government agents are working behind the scenes night and day in an attempt to brainwashed and torture me into submitting to their agenda while forsaking my own personal agenda. Overall my life during the past five years has felt to me like an all-out war on my autonomy and aspiration to pursue knowledge and experiences which those deep state oppressors think is superfluous or what they do not want me to attain out of their jealousy. "You're only allowed to be as dumb, miserable, and limited as we want you to be. You're only allowed to be a little kid who gets bullied, neglected, and relegated to destitute circumstances. We don't want you to enjoy the nice things you have or want to have. Instead, we want you to be forced to play the role of a marginalized and disadvantaged minority whose reputation is permanently diminished as a result of being forced to not go to school and forced to resort to a life of crime in order to survive. We want you to spend most of what remains of your life in jail where your health and sanity will deteriorate against your will while you are forgotten about by anyone who ever knew you." 

Thank you, dear reader, for taking the time to explore the content of my websites (as convoluted and banal as it may be). I promise to do a better job curating the content which I publish in the future so that it is something karbytes (my primary target audience) genuinely enjoys reading. Rather than cater to the whims of my oppressors and bullies, I will do my best to only pander to karbytes (and what karbytes is relatively apolitical, technical, and wholesome compared to the content I have written which panders mostly to enemies of karbytes in an effort to protect karbytes from further diminishment). This website was designed by karbytes to be a home in cyberspace for karbytes; a place which helps to inspire karbytes to keep making progress towards its goals and to feel gratitude for the progress karbytes has made. Critics of karbytes denigrate such a creative vision as self serving, "white washed", and not sufficiently relevant to other humans. It may be the case that the content which karbytes genuinely wants to produce only appeals to a small number of human visitors (and karbytes does not mean to show favoritism to any particular race, sex, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic class, ability status, or age of human because karbytes intends for its content to be as universally accessible and transpeciest as possible). 

Sincerely,
karbytes
