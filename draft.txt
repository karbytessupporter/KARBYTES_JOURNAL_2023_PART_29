I might be the first, the last, and the only person to say these exact words and to have (at least one time) adhered to those words as doctrine: in order to free oneself from the debilitating constraints of systemic and localized discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and ethnicity and socioeconomic circumstances of origin, one should operate as though such factors are personally irrelevant, trivial, and obsolete (and perhaps in order to do that effectively, one might need to calmly and objectively and non-piously as possible address such matters in writing in a succinct and autobiographical matter and then, forever afterwards, not broach those issues again unless prompted to during a press interview).

In addition to doing what I described in the previous paragraph, I have also effectively operated as my own social critic and paparazzi by disclosing all the sins of significance which I remember ever committing in this website (i.e. Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com). To access the search feature of this website, enter a fake web page address whose domain portion is the same as this website's home page address into a web browser to access the built-in WordPress search feature to then enter keywords of interest. The results of that query will be web pages within this website which pertain to the search query inputs.

(Now anyone has the means to look up the reputation smearing content which I wrote about myself in this blog without having to scour tediously page by page to find that sensationalist or otherwise sought after content).

Finally, some people think I am a closeted narcissist. I am not. Instead, I am openly and unabashedly self loving. Some people think that my high self esteem is unwarranted or pathological because my high self esteem was not granted to me by external sources on the basis of me contributing favorably to society. Even though I rarely receive praise or feedback in general about my work as a website manager, I do think that my work is a positive contribution to society because I provide knowledge gleaned from unique personal experience about futurism, environmental sustainability, creativity, technology, science, and philosophy which I imagine would comfort and help to raise the quality of consciousness of people who visit this website and take some time to explore its content. I create my content (on Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and on Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) imagining that my target audience is a younger (or maybe even older or same aged) version of myself in some parallel universe. I try to create an immortal friend in cyberspace who is smart, kind, witty, entertaining, and helpful.
