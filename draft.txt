I almost spent more time in "the losing position" until I remembered that I am playing a Game. "Feeling that one has no real time off is one of the greatest sources of destitution," I thought I heard a "head radio voice" say. If that statement is true, then I could say that I will not stop feeling destitute until I hear no more "head radio voices" but then thought about how much the "head radio voices" provided critical timely feedback which helped me probably save more time, money, health, and cognitive functions than I would have without such intervention. If what I just suggested is true, then I could have a very productive and satisfying Summer Camp by Karbytes experience. (As I write this neighbors standing in their yards on the other side of a field where my dad's house (which is my current legal residence address) seem to be making disapproving vocalizations at me (but I have a habit of trying to tune them out because I think they are trying to sabotage my writing process by essentially trying to censor my style and content out of existence so that literally everything in their vicinity is tailor made and home owner association committee approved). I would go inside thr house to write, but the air quality is rather poor in there (due to lingering cigarette smoke) and because I just feel more comfortable writing this note outside debajo del cielo where I assume many satellites and drones are watching and recording my every thought and move. Most of all, I feel morally obligated to sit outside to finish this note because I think that too many people have been acting like tyrants and bullies who torture and terrorize everyone around them (or at least me) into submission. Those ogres seem to think only they deserve to enjoy their backyards. Fuck those sour rotting cunts.
