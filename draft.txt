It's only four days into my summer camp experience and I am already getting around to addressing subject matter which I think was "supposed to" take ten days for me to get around to. Good! I think that after I get my two most recent tweets backed up to this web page as screenshot images, I can move onto more enjoyable subjects because I did the essential prerequisite "groundwork" of mentally and infrastructurally preparing to be one of the noble "non priority" humans who eventually offs itself in order to make way for "priority humans". I would rather make the most of my life even if it is not nearly as long as I want it to be. I also would rather not fight with people. I would rather spend my life enjoying my hobbies while doing my best to avoid conflict with other humans or other animals which could harm me. Finally, it should be noted that I deleted the tweets which I saved screenshots of in journal entry # x of the year 2023 (because those deleted tweets do not seem to be logically nor emotionally congruent with my latest two tweets).
