<p>For the past few hours I have been bullied by what I think is the source of the sound effects I have caricatured as pig_gorl: law enforcement. Using some kind of brain-to-computer interface or some other &#8220;mind reading&#8221; technology to decipher my thoughts and some kind of mechanism which forces me to hear verbal and auditory responses from what I think is law enforcement, I have involuntarily been engaged in constant <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;telepathic&#8221; communication</a> with what I think is law enforcement since early 2019. During the past few hours I have been noticing how much of what I have been hearing from what I think is law enforcement sounds like an angry, sarcastic, and sadistic African American woman who seems to think that I deserve to be constantly interrupted and bullied by her and that she should act as some kind of abusive authority figure who bullies me into complying with her wishes. This may be an attempt on her part to get me to be less racist and more interested in and supportive of &#8220;people of color&#8221;. She seems to think that I need to be discouraged from identifying as, associating with, and pursuing interests which she thinks are commonly associated with white men (especially white men who seem to live in relatively affluent circumstances and who seem to have no problem immersing themselves in scientific, technological, and otherwise &#8220;geeky&#8221; or &#8220;nerdy&#8221; hobbies and subject matter). <span style="background:#ffff00">She seems to think that I should be made to feel like a relatively disadvantaged woman of color and suffer the kinds of systemic racism, sexism, and other discrimination-based unfavorable treatment as a means to enlist me to be some kind of human rights activist against my will (or a scapegoat to be the target of her cathartic rage unleashings).</span></p>
<p>My biggest issue of contention with other people is anthropocentricism (which is operating as though humans are the most important aspects of reality and that only humanistic subject matter deserves attention). I juxtapose anthropocentricism with natural science and analytical philosophy (and natural science and analytical philosophy are what I prefer to spend the majority of my primary website focusing on). I do not believe that I am truly more racist or more sexist than most other humans are. In fact, I would say that my propensity to be more autistic-minded than most of the human population has made me more open-minded, egalitarian, and non-favoritist than what most of the human population is because my sense of self and worldview are not as dependent on socializing and tribal affiliation as are most humans&#8217;s. That means that I am more like an alien from another planet than most humans probably are (which means that I tend to use language which does not use much &#8220;insider&#8221; jargon and having to prove one&#8217;s loyalty and favorable rank within some small subset of the human population). Instead, I try to be as logical, objective, and general as possible in my use of language. I think that such linguistic and cultural preferences differ sharply with the angry black tyrant&#8217;s and she is using coercive psychological torture as a means to try to force me to assimilate to her linguistic and cultural patterns.</p>
<p>I do not condone that angry black tyrant interfering with my life and trying to force me to assimilate to her ways. I also think that her meddling in my life has not helped to make me less racist nor more supportive of disadvantaged (human) minorities. Though I would like to promote a safer, healthier, happier, and more egalitarian world for all humans, I have felt compelled to &#8220;play the bad guy&#8221; in order to get people like that angry black tyrant to stop using me as a political pawn who is terrorized into being a slave to someone else&#8217;s &#8220;politically correct&#8221; agenda (especially if that agenda seems to undermine my own preferred cultural identity (which is decidedly &#8220;white male (nerd) supremacist&#8221;).</p>
<p>I am sick of letting &#8220;social justice warriors&#8221; (or &#8220;humanities majors&#8221; as I sometimes call them) get between me and what I would rather be focusing on (which is science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and non-dogmatic and eclectic approaches to philosophy, religion, spirituality, art, and anthropology). I am sick of having to contort myself into positions which I think are &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; and otherwise distasteful to me just to avoid getting punished by such tyrants. If that means that I turn away from being more philanthropic in order to save myself from feeling like a hostage to someone else&#8217;s agenda, then that is what it means. Rather than try to help make the world a better place under the dictates of people I think are ugly, unkind, unintelligent, and daresay even harmful, I would honestly rather leave such people behind and allow them to continue to suffer what they think is injustice committed against them in particular (on the basis of systemic racism, et cetera). I do think that the black community is responsible for most of the violence it has suffered because I have personally witnessed and studied from second hand sources ample evidence that such people are generally more brutish, sexist, violent, and anti-intellectual than white people generally are. Go ahead and call me Adolf Hitler if it makes you feel better. I won&#8217;t argue against you. In fact, I have recently admitted (and still admit to) approving that people I find to be severely deleterious to my agenda to be (as painlessly and quickly as possible) murdered. I do not want such people breeding and filling the limited habitable spaces with their garbage and turmoil. I see such people as pathogens who lower everyone else&#8217;s quality of life and obstruct technological advancements which I believe is, by far, the most effective and scalable means of solving humanity&#8217;s problems. The humanities majors, in my opinion, do little more than act like overgrown children demanding that other people who are smarter, more hard working, and more effective at solving pragmatic problems accommodate their ineptitude and reward them for it.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Rather than try to treat each human individual as equally worthy of my time, attention, money, and affection, I think it is more fruitful for me to be favoritist towards those who share my values and those who I think are good role models while generally ignoring everyone else.</span> If the people I prefer to promote or to associate with are not &#8220;diverse&#8221; enough for your taste, then so be it! I won&#8217;t even bother pointing out your hypocrisy because that is a waste of my time. Too often people like you have been quick to threaten or even initiate violence against me merely for expressing an opinion nonviolently or even for merely using logic to explain myself. Just because you have been mistreated does not mean that you are justified in mistreating others or even in retaliating (because, as the saying goes, &#8220;two wrongs do not make a right&#8221;). I am sick of having to deal with people who seem to be as morally and intellectually mature as little kids or as savages living in third world countries. I believe that the best way to help disadvantaged human populations catch up to technologically and culturally advanced populations is for the leaders in such innovation to continue excelling in their domain so that the more primitive people have role models to look up to and ready-made solutions being handed down to them (virtually for free). All that is asked of you is to not be terrible to each other while &#8220;white man&#8217;s burden&#8221; does the bulk of solving your problems for you and without any expectation of reward nor gratitude on your part.</p>
<p>You people have taken up enough of my time. I would rather turn my back on you people and leave you to fend for yourselves without my assistance nor involvement. I no longer wish to give you space on my platform. Get your own damned platform. Learn how to market yourself in ways which do not amount to violence, vandalism, censorship, and other abusive tactics. At the very least, try not to kill each other over a pair of shoes and such. Grow up!</p>
