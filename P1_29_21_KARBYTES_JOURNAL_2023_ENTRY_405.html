<p>I decided to briefly stop to rest and make a note while backpacking up the big hill through Castro Valley about something I was thinking about during the past few hours: the idea that my &#8220;bubble&#8221; has yet to &#8220;pop&#8221;. What I mean by that is that my lingering mental construct of having private thoughts and private perceptions created out of raw sensory inputs has yet to be completely obliterated. Perhaps it is up to me to tear down the last of those walls which separate my &#8220;inner experience&#8221; from the &#8220;inner experiences&#8221; which other animals experience and assume that other animals and information processing machines can read my mind and that it is futile for me to try to hide anything I know from becoming known by other nervous systems. I think it is more relaxing to live by the maxim that I have nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of. After all, <span style="background:#ffff00">my research into how my own mind works and how physical reality and society and computation works has lead me to conclude that all events are entirely and fundamentally determined by lower level physical processes which operate in a consistently algorithmic manner. Such processes only appear to be mysterious and random to minds which have yet to gather sufficient data from those &#8220;black box&#8221; operations.</span> But what about &#8220;free will&#8221;? Does it exist or is it just an illusion? I think it&#8217;s just an illusion but I could be wrong. <span style="background:#ffff00">Perhaps some information processing agents are advanced enough to literally &#8220;play God&#8221; by literally causing spontaneous phenomena to emerge literally out of pure nothingness first as thoughts and then later as physical manipulations of their apparently external physical environment.</span> The point of this note is to excuse myself (and others) to not have to try so hard to control their thoughts or even their actions using the justification that we are puppets being controlled by factors beyond our scope or understanding and as part of being interdependent components of an all-encompassing reality which somehow enables whatever transpires in it to occur in exactly the manner they occur. It seems like it would create a lot of unnecessary suffering to try to control reality because reality seems to be incomprehensibly large (and so large that even if <span style="background:#ffff00">someone is convinced that it attained omniscience there is no way to conclusively prove it (though perhaps there is a way to attain omniscience and to conclusively prove it which I am not currently aware of)).</span></p>
<p>I thought that it might be possible for a human to attain omniscience through &#8220;out of body experiences&#8221; such as through death and altered states of consciousness but, once those humans return to normal waking consciousness like whatever is presumably being used to write this note (by karbytes, of course), the knowledge which was previously available to that person while its consciousness was able to leave the confines of its relatively limited and deterministic nervous system is no longer accessible. If what I said is true, then it would be hard to prove that knowledge beyond what a human ordinarily experiences in normal waking consciousness is attainable without that human transcending its human nervous system because its human nervous system is not configured to render such experiences.</p>
<p>One last thing I would like to share is an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/is-it-real-or-imagined-how-your-brain-tells-the-difference-20230524/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> I recently found which Quanta Magazine published about how the human nervous system distinguishes hallucinations from &#8220;real&#8221; objects. I would like to add that, <span style="background:#ffff00">based on my own firsthand empirical investigation into how dreams work, dreams do seem to have common features which I do not ever remember observing &#8220;in real life&#8221; such as scenes abruptly transitioning which makes it appear that I am being teleported from one location to another instantaneously.</span> Also, taste data seems to be lacking in my dreams. My dreams tend to be almost entirely tactile (i.e. the feeling of getting punched or tickled), visual (i.e. three dimensional and multicolored objects), and auditory (i.e. voices talking, screeching, and sometimes even music which is quite elaborate).</p>
