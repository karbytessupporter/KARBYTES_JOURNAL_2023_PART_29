<p>I decided to take my red Coleman tent (which I bought from Target for approximately $70) out of the closet to set up today so that I would have some protection from mountain lions, rain, and some extra privacy. I took that tent all the way to the area close to where I camped last night. My original idea was to set up the tent on the hillside which is south of the entrance to the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.redwoodhikes.com/EastBay/Ramage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ramage Peak trail</a> and east of the Redwood Canyon Golf Course, but when I did, several horses gathered around me thinking that I had food. I was afraid of getting kicked or trampled, so I rather foolishly left my backpack and tent near the bush I was planning on setting up my tent behind (so that people looking up at the hill from the vantage of Redwood road would not see the tent). I cringed when I saw the horses manipulate my backpack with their hooves because my precious laptop computer was in there. I tried &#8220;negotiating&#8221; with the horses using my body language and vocalizations to let me retrieve my stuff but they were quite belligerent and ganged up on me. After a while, they finally moved out of the way so that I could grab my stuff. Stupidly I tried to set the tent up again in their pasture area and the herd gathered around thinking the tent had food in it. I left the tent components on the hillside and climbed higher up the hill in order to wait for them to move out of the way so that I could grab my tent components and bring them outside the pasture to set up my tent somewhere outside that pasture area. (I took two decent photographs from that vantage which I uploaded to Instagram and GitHub). After getting all of my stuff back and hopping the fence back to the other side, I set up my tent in what I hope is a relatively hidden spot (but tomorrow I will take down my tent and set it up somewhere else which is not so close to the road). After I set up the tent, I heard some coyotes making loud vocalizations (i.e. howling and barking) and saw them on the hillside. One of the coyotes sat in one place for approximately five minutes. I saw its head turn to look around. I also heard turkeys making loud vocalizations (i.e. gobbling) seemingly in response to the coyotes making noises. Now it is dark and I hear crickets chirping and frogs croaking down by the creek which passes through the golf course. I also just heard some raccoons making squeaking sounds. Then I heard the raccoons make softer vocalization sounds which sound very similar to the vocalizations which my pet fire bellied toads from childhood used to make at night in my room.</p>
<p>I must admit that having this tent is very nice. I was browsing more tents by the brand on Amazon dot Com and saw one which has &#8220;darkroom technology&#8221; for blocking out sunlight and heat (and for housing up to two people). That would be a more ideal tent for me than what I currently have (because the tent I currently have lacks that &#8220;darkroom technology&#8221; and is excessively large for my needs; providing enough room for me to almost stand all the way up inside of and enough room for four people to lay down inside of). What I plan to do with my $100 Friday allowance is order a new backpack from Amazon (the same brand which I am currently using (which is Teton)) so that I can use my current backpack (which is approximately two years old and barely functional after having several broken zippers, missing buckles, and some holes in the fabric) as a backup backpack or as a storage container for transporting my stuff (and I only have approximately $500 or less worth of stuff and less than what would fit in a small closet). Besides getting a new laptop computer (eventually), my next purchase over $300 would be a commuter bicycle (which I imagine would cost approximately $800). I am not making much of an effort to save money right now because my income is very small at this time, but I do seem to be saving slightly more than what I spend. Like I said in earlier journal entries, I do not intend to start looking for a new job until after I complete approximately 90 days of my Summer Camp by Karbytes experience.</p>
<p>(By the way my laptop appears to be working fine even though it was &#8220;randomly&#8221; shutting down frequently for a period lasting no longer than approximately 2 days sometime within the past two weeks. I am quite enjoying using my laptop in my cozy, affordable, and portable outdoor bedroom of a tent. I just heard some owls hooting and making harmonies).</p>
