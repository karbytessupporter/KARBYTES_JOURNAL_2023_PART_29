Finally, any and all human citizens (whether they are incarcerated or not) are encouraged to get an entirely state subsidized sterilization procedure performed. Regardless of whether or not a human is determined by the state to be a criminal, any sterilization procedure a human undergoes is designed to be minimally invasive. Basically, the sterilization surgeries amount to fallopian tube blockage or sperm tube blockage. Also, each human is entitled to state funded health care and freedom from violence and torture. The only legal violence and torture permitted are short-term incapacitation means deployed by law enforcement to safely detain criminal suspects and to keep further violence from erupting. Retribution is not the aim of law enforcement. Harm prevention is the only aim of law enforcement.


Correct the other part. It's not removal or orgabsn it's tube tying
