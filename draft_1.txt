The following conversation takes place between fictional characters named X and Y. The conversation was written by karbytes in order to help karbytes clarify and share some of the thoughts karbytes has been having pertaining to  panpsychism, solipsism, mortality, and physics. The conversation was written while karbytes was housed in a secluded wilderness region at night inside of a tent without any other humans in karbytes vicinity (according to karbytes). 

A word from karbytes: Do not worry. I'm neither suicidal at this time nor foolish enough to sleep in mountain lion territory without a tent. Just because the fictional characters I depicted in this journal entry suggest that the universe I live in ceases to exist while I sleep means that my sleeping body is safe from getting attacked by carnivorous predators. Even if X or Y is correct about any of the things it suggested, it could be that my mental model of reality is so brutal and rigidly aligned to certain expectations that the simulation I apparently return to between periods of dreamless sleep includes the illusion of continuity such that a self fulfilling prophecy about me getting eaten by a mountain lion comes true. Even if I get to reincarnate limitlessly many times in limitlessly many different types of simulated realities, I still prefer to avoid excruciatingly painful experiences because my essential decision making capacity seems to be hedonistic. Perhaps someday the algorithms which control my perceptions, thoughts, and behavior will be something other than hedonism and I will hence lose my desire to avoid intense suffering.
