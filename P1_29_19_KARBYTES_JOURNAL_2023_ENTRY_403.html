<p>This morning I had some weird dreams. One of those dreams included me having sex with a former partner and friend of mine named AJP and me playing heavy metal guitar (I&#8217;m not sure in what order) and then AJP&#8217;s voice somehow becoming the voice of some disembodied narrator talking to me while I was climbing horizontally along some chain linked fence next to some mustard flowers. I said, &#8220;Is it illegal to be single?&#8221; The voice answered yes and said that I was just what he was looking for in a partner. Then I suggested out loud that it was only illegal to be single because it meant that I was not being paid by other people to exist (and apparently a job was not enough while a sufficiently high paying career was only possible with ample support from friends and family). I said that my parents are rather wealthy and that they give me sufficient money to live on (which meant that I could continue being single). Then the dream transitioned to me waking up to see that my right eyeball was apparently not detecting any light. I used my fingers to pry the eyelid of my right eye open because it was swollen shut from some kind of infection (but my eye was still working nevertheless). In that dream I was camping near some hilltop convenience store which looked like a souvenir shop from northern California near the big old growth redwoods but that store was overlooking the San Francisco Bay Area from the east side.</p>
<p>After I actually woke up, I wrote a prompt for myself which specifies the requirements for my next self-assigned software engineering project as follows:</p>
<p><em>Instructions to karbytes: Write a command line C++ application which (a) prompts the user to input a real number value within a specific range of real number values which includes positive and negative values to store in a floating-point number variable named base, (b) prompts the user to input a real number value within a specific range of real number values which includes positive and negative values to store in a floating-point number variable named exponent, (c) computes the value of base multiplied by base for exponent number of times without using any C++ library functions such as pow(base,exponent) to perform that power calculation, and (d) displays the result (i.e. base to the power of exponent) to some arbitrary number of digits of precision as command line output.</em></p>
<p>Unlike previous code pages which I published on <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>, I intend for my next code pages to have a slightly different format. Instead of making the introductory section of my new code pages display a summary of a finished software application I wrote, I intend to make the new introductory sections a simple prompt to karbytes which are similar to the kinds of code-writing prompts I submitted to <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chatGPT</a> (and the results of such prompting were sometimes decent working pieces of code while other results were logically or arithmetically incorrect). I only intend to consult Stack Overflow and chatGPT for help on my coding assignments if I experience difficulty making progress on a particular aspect of those assignments. I will do my best to do as much of the work on those assignments myself. Besides, I like earning an understanding of how algorithms work instead of just copying a working answer from some author other than myself.</p>
<p>Anyway, I eventually packed up my tent and left the forest I was camping in to head to downtown Castro Valley to get some coffee and groceries before heading back up the hill to my house where I am currently located as I write this note. I stopped by Redwood Canyon Golf Course to fill my water bottle at the drinking fountain. As I headed out the entrance of the golf course, I saw what appeared to be the same black cat which I saw yesterday in the same area. That black cat seemed to be a stray and it walked over to sit in the grass to attentively listen to birds chirping in the adjacent bushes. As I walked past the cat, I saw that it had orange-yellow eyes and a large head. I assume that it is an unneutered male cat because of its large neck.</p>
<p>(Speaking of cats I got to recently visit Brea who was curled up on her blanket on the table in the living room. She purred vigorously as I pet her head and let her push off of my forearm with her hind legs. She almost falls off the table some times because she leans into me. She also usually splays her front paws in a cutesy manner. I remember when I was going to the adoption center with my dad several years ago to adopt her and noticing, as soon as we entered the room where the cages were located, her paw reaching out through the cage door making those grabby motions as though to say, &#8220;Pick me! Pick me!&#8221;).</p>
<p>Anyway, I have been feeling a lot more cheerful and on track with my goals recently. I feel a sense of belonging in the world and fitting into a unique niche in a rather unique and nostalgic part of the world. I appreciate it very much.</p>
<p>Anyway, last night&#8217;s <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_402/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry</a> was a bit heavy handed, somber, and heady. I decided that it would be good for me to take a break (perhaps for a month) from doing psychedelics and weed and avoid the rather morbid and speculative subjects I was talking about in that journal because, quite frankly, I am a bit sick of those subjects and because I want to appreciate my mortal human existence more rather keep booting myself out of having an ego. I will play with my little C++ and JavaScript applications, read the news, and go on cheap adventures locally. I&#8217;m very comfortable now not using a car to get around. I noticed my physical fitness levels have improved and that I have more stamina and strength than I did even a month ago.</p>
