I would also like to add that, in addition to the societal conditions I described in the previous paragraphs, XX chromosomed humans who remain in such a society as vestigial members will be forbidden from getting pregnant (and if they become  pregnant, they will be detained and forced to undergo abortion if the pregnancy is sufficiently "early term" or else give birth if the pregnancy is later term while in prison). If the pregnancy was determined by the technocracy to have been caused by the XX chromosomed human getting raped, then that human individual will only be held in prison as long as it takes to either perform the abortion or else deliver the baby. If the pregnancy was determined by the technocracy to have been caused by the pregnant human by that pregnant human's own volition, then the human will be incarcerated for up to five years in prison and forced to have its uterus surgically removed as a means to discourage humans from becoming voluntarily pregnant in the future. Also, any humans (or sufficiently intelligent agents) who were determined by the technocracy to have committed rape will be incarcerated for up to ten years and have their reproductive organs surgically removed if they have reproductive organs.
