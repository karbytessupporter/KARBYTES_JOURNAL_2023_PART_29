<p>Today I made some updates to the web page named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/epistemology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EPISTEMOLOGY</a> in my primary website (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>). Then I took a picture of Brea the cat while she was briefly in bread loaf shape before she got up and changed position. I do not think she enjoys being photographed. I did think that photograph of her looked good because that scene looks similar enough to what I imagine to be the main &#8220;base camp&#8221; lodge which is part of my ~90 day Summer Camp by Karbytes experience. (I imagine that I am in some kind of magical world which has parts of it which look like they are located in the 1950s, 1960s, or 1970s but with connections back to 2023 (and later) such as smartphones, Internet routers, and relatively modern popular science books in paperback (and some of those books are stacked on the table adjacent to Brea)). It&#8217;s a do-it-yourself, experimental, and relatively solitary adult &#8220;occupational therapy&#8221; program disguised as camping and outdoor recreation. Hiking, camping, and observing wildlife is not all I am doing during that experience. I also am reading books, surfing the web, updating websites, writing code, practicing musical instruments, taking magic mushrooms, watching porn, and doing anything which seems to fit into my experience and imbue it with some kind of meaning for me personally. I consider it to mostly be about forging a deep and lifelong sense of personal spirituality which centers around naturalistic philosophy, logical analysis, artistic expression, and direct experience with reality through the senses and body. I am allowing my intuition to rather effortlessly guide my actions much the way solitary wild animals traverse terrain and make decisions which enables them to survive and to have fun.</p>
<p>As an aside, the first two times I attempted to upload that image to Instagram, Instagram only displayed that image as a blank white square. I was using the house Wi-Fi to upload that image and switched to using my mobile AT&amp;T data to try uploading that image a third time (and the correct image was displayed on Instagram). When I went to the garage to finish making this journal entry, I thought I heard a neighbor say, &#8220;because that&#8217;s not something your mom would want you to read,&#8221; but I will assume I misheard whoever that was and that the voice I heard on the other side of the garage door was not pertaining to me. Like yesterday (and pretty much every time I spent time at my dad&#8217;s house as the only human in that house), I have heard the thought police in the form of pig_gorl making nonstop whining, whimpering, and complaining vocalizations which do not stop until I return to the wilderness. I plan to return to the wilderness after my clothes finish drying. I washed my clothes because I got lots of dust and trace amounts of poison oak residue on them during yesterday&#8217;s shenanigan in the horse pasturing area on that hillside. I plan to go to a more suitable camping place tonight so that I do not get in trouble with law enforcement or property owners.</p>
<p>About that aside in the previous paragraph: I have noticed quite a bit of unsupportive and misery-mongering feedback from other people about my endeavors while going about minding my own business. The only people who seem to go out of their way to shit on my parade are people who do not seem to have immersive hobbies and people who rarely do outdoor recreation. By contrast, I do see a lot of outdoor athletes hiking, biking, running, and playing sports in the areas I frequent and such people seem exceptionally polite and physically (and mentally) fit. I am not trying to make anyone feel bad but I do think some people do try to make me feel bad (because those people feel bad about the decisions they made or circumstances they are mired in). Oh well. I will do my best to avoid crossing paths with miserable people. I will do my best to mind my own business and stay focused on my personal endeavors (because what I do has plenty of built-in challenges which means that I do not need to manufacture adversity in order to not grow soft).</p>
